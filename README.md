# to do list
this is a simple implementation of to do list in C
I made use of linked lists for implementing it. The application can add tasks, remove tasks based on index and view the current tasks at hand. One can also assign priorities to tasks and view them in various modes.
The app also has a stats mode that displays the current user statistics for the tasks in the code. 

## features
- add tasks
- remove tasks
- view tasks at hand
- add priority to tasks (low, medium or high)
- view tasks on the basis of priority
- save and load tasks from text files

## getting started
to use the application, follow the steps given below
1. clone the repository
2. compile the code (toDoList.c) or run the executable file (toDoList.exe)
3. refer to the demo.md file to see the app in action
